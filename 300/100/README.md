# 100 - Create Your Own Digital Twin

> Build a digital twin to create content for social media marketing

You can create an AI character like Aitana Lopez, Lil Miquela or Lu Do Magalu in RenderNet by uploading a face, using the character-builder wizard to customize it, naming the character, and saving it for future use.

In our case, we'll be creating a Digital Twin, in other words a copy of ourself.
