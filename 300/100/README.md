# 100 - Create Your Own Digital Twin

> Build a digital twin to create content for social media marketing

You can create an AI character like Aitana Lopez, Lil Miquela or Lu Do Magalu in RenderNet by uploading a face, using the character-builder wizard to customize it, naming the character, and saving it for future use.

In our case, we'll be creating a Digital Twin, in other words a copy of ourself.

Open the RenderNet AI application at https://app.rendernet.ai/ and login with your account.

Choose **Create new** when selecting a character:

When prompted, choose **Start with a face**:

![Create_New_Character_002](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc8ced75-3014-4764-9878-b3eafe5d24ef)

Pick a face, in our case our own face:

Choose **Upload image**:

As we have not yet uploaded our face, the ```Image asset library``` will not yet contain an image of our face. Choose **select a file from the folder** by clicking on the **+** sign to upload a new image.

As our face fits neatly in the frame, we can forego the cropping, and continue by pressing **Next**:
