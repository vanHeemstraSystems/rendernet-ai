# 100 - Create Your Own Digital Twin

> Build a digital twin to create content for social media marketing

You can create an AI character like Aitana Lopez, Lil Miquela or Lu Do Magalu in RenderNet by uploading a face, using the character-builder wizard to customize it, naming the character, and saving it for future use.

In our case, we'll be creating a Digital Twin, in other words a copy of ourself.

Open the RenderNet AI application at https://app.rendernet.ai/ and login with your account.

Choose **Create new** when selecting a character:

![Create_New_Character_001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98f3a6d4-fe73-4c45-80e5-55ad98fbde13)

When prompted, choose **Start with a face**:

![Create_New_Character_002](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc8ced75-3014-4764-9878-b3eafe5d24ef)

Pick a face, in our case our own face:

![Willem_van_Heemstra_Face](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccccdc8a-8dd4-40d0-ba93-b122e5778181)

Choose **Upload image**:

![Create_New_Character_003](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b8b78dd-4d5f-4df5-b327-54be20f80099)

As we have not yet uploaded our face, the ```Image asset library``` will not yet contain an image of our face. Choose **select a file from the folder** by clicking on the **+** sign to upload a new image.

As our face fits neatly in the frame, we can forego the cropping, and continue by pressing **Next**:

![Create_New_Character_005](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07ce3330-bc53-4a5b-a115-c26ec2d37f4a)

From the ```Design your character``` dialogue window, set Style to **Realistic**, Gender to **Man**, Age to **Middle-Aged**, and Hair Type & Color to **Short** and **Black** (as Grey is not an option provided).

![Create_New_Character_006](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50c325c9-3705-4646-8c4b-6cb37a7973bd)

Click **Next**.

We are limited to 10 characters as the length of a name for the character, hence we set it to **WvHeemstra**. 

![Create_New_Character_007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5de67b71-b396-42e4-98a0-0bd0f802d665)

Click **Save**.

After a couple of seconds, voila, Our Character is Ready!

![Create_New_Character_008](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0718218-19f2-4015-b5a3-d435e7c158c4)

Click **Use this character**.
